        <System.P css={STYLES_HEADER}>What is Slate?</System.P>
        <System.P css={STYLES_TEXT}>
          Slate is the first public file storage network designed for research and collaboration. It
          is an open source alternative to services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and is built on
          IPFS and Textileâ€™s Powergate.
        </System.P>

        <System.P css={STYLES_HEADER}>What can I use it for?</System.P>
        <System.P css={STYLES_TEXT}>
          Slate is a modern solution for storing and sharing files on the web. It provides you with
          a suite of tools that allow you to easily create moodboards, organize research, and create
          archives with your files all in one space. Slate supports most file types for images,
          videos, audio, and documents.
        </System.P>

        <System.P css={STYLES_HEADER}>What makes Slate different?</System.P>
        <System.P css={STYLES_TEXT}>
          Besides being built with technologies designed around trust and transparency, Slate is the
          first storage application that also works as a social file sharing network. This makes it
          so that you can seamlessly search and access files that are shared publicly on the network
          by other people.
        </System.P>

        <System.P css={STYLES_HEADER}>Can I get involved?</System.P>
        <System.P css={STYLES_TEXT}>
          Yes! All of Slate is built out in the open by a community of contributors around the
          world. Join our Slack or head over to our GitHub to get in on the action.
