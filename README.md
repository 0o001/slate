### Introduction

![Slate Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/310223/92346093-94bb3b80-f080-11ea-8ac6-c4cce3cd1aec.gif)

Slate is the first open source file storage application designed to encourage collaboration and research across a distributed network. It is a first step towards enabling a thriving network for data storage and transactions powered by IPFS, Filecoin and Textile that is open and usable for everyone. Our goal is to provide a meaningful story for every feature the protocol provides today and in the future. The Slate Project is the byproduct of a growing community of contributors from around the world.

Slate is tightly scoped for the present and more broadly thought out for the future. Our primary objective is to create a best-in-class experience for uploading, collecting, and sharing media. Additional filetypes will be supported, but our focus is to start with the pieces that apply to everyone and then dial into more specific formats.

Working on Slate starts by cloning the repo :)

```sh

```

### .env

You must create a `.env` file if you want to work on the service.

- You must setup your own postgres or hosted postgres.
- You must have your own Textile hub account setup
- You will have to run 3 other servers manually until we automate.

```

POSTGRES_DATABASE=XXX
LOCAL_PASSWORD_SECRET=XXX
LOCAL_PASSWORD_ROUNDS_MANUAL=5
LOCAL_PASSWORD_ROUNDS=14
TEXTILE_HUB_KEY=XXX
TEXTILE_HUB_SECRET=XXX
JWT_SECRET=XXX
ALLOWED_HOST=localhost:1337

NEXT_PUBLIC_URI_SHOVEL=http://localhost:4242
NEXT_PUBLIC_URI_FIJI=ws://localhost:6464

```

### Setup pubsub server

- In another terminal window, clone https://github.com/slate-engineering/fiji
- Use the same `.env` secret values as the root server.

### Setup file upload server

- In another terminal window, clone https://github.com/slate-engineering/shovel
- Use the same `.env` secret values as the root server.

### Setup search server

- In another terminal window, clone https://github.com/slate-engineering/lens
- Use the same `.env` secret values as the root server.

### Install and run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Visit `localhost:1337` in a browser.
- You should have 3 terminal screens open unless you don't want real time updates and file upload support.

<!-- ## Design System

Our design system is out of date and could use an update.

- [Use our components](https://slate.host/_/system)
- [Design System Release Repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slate-react-system) -->

## Developer API

Slate has a Developer API that allows you upload files using code and HTTP.

Every user who creates an account on Slate can use the API. Here is an example:

```js
const response = await fetch("https://slate.host/api/v1/get", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Basic XXX-YOUR-SLATE-KEY-XXX",
  },
});
```
